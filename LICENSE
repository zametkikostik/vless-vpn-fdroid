  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  The GNU General Public License applies to any software or other work
that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Each licensee is addressed
as "you".  "Programs" and "Works" mean any copyrightable work.

  The GNU General Public License applies to any program that contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.

THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING

DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.
